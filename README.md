# Operations on Singly Linked List

1. Create a linked list by adding each node at the end of previous node
2. creates a linked list by adding the pervious list at the end of the new node
3. Traverse through a linked list
4. Insert the node at the beginning of the list
5. Insert the node at the end of the list
6. Check whether the element is there in the list or not
7. Count the occurences of element in the list
8. Insert an element in the list by specifying the position
9. Insert a node after a given element
10. Insert a node before a given element
11. Constrain to put the linked list in ascending order
12. Delete an element by specifying the position
13. Delete a node that occurs after the input element in the linked list
14. Delete a node that occurs before the input element in the linked list
15. Delete all the occurences of an element
16. Delete the middle element of the list
17. Reverse the list
18. Arrange the list as such that all even numbers occur first and all odds at the end

# Operations on Doubly Linked List

Most of the operations are similar to the operations on singly lists. They have not been included

1. Create a linked list by adding the pervious list at the end of the new node
2. Create a linked list by adding each node at the end of previous node
3. Insert the node at the beginning of the list
4. Insert the node at the end of the list
5. Reverse a list by swapping its contents
6. Reverse a list by swapping the links of doubly linked list
7. Traverse through a linked list

# Operarions on Circular Queue

The circular queue has been implemented using an array.

1. Insert
2. Delete
3. Display

---

# Operations on Binary Search Tree

1. Insert
2. Inorder traversal
3. Preorder traversal
4. Postorder traversal
5. Iterative Inorder traversal
6. Search an element
7. Delete Element
8. Find Maximum Element
9. Find Minimum Element
10. Count Nodes
11. Count Leafs
12. Count Nodes with one child
13. Find the Max Depth
